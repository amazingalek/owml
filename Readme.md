# Outer Wilds Mod Loader

OWML is the mod loader and mod framework for Outer Wilds. It patches Outer Wilds to load mods, and provides mods with a framework to interact with the game. OWML is inspired by SMAPI for Stardew Valley.

## How it works

OWML does the following:
1. Displays the mods found in the Mods folder.
2. Patches the game to make it call the mod loader.
3. Starts the game which calls the mod loader.
4. The mod loader does this for each mod:
   1. Creates a new Unity game object containing the mod.
   2. Initializes the mod with a mod helper.

## Sample mods

One mod is included as an example. It's disabled by default, enable in manifest.json.

|Sample mod|Description|
|----------|-----------|
|OWML.EnableDebugMode|Enables the built-in debug mode in the game. Highlights: cycle through debug UIs with F1, warp to planets with the number keys, and explode the sun with the End key.|

## For players

With Vortex:
1. Download OWML and extract the zip file.
2. Put the OWML folder in ï»¿the game's root folder, usually C:\Program Files\Epic Games\OuterWilds.
3. Install [the Vortex extension](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/73/).
4. Use [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/1/) to install mods and start the game.

Without Vortex:
1. Download OWML and extract the zip file anywhere you want.
2. [Download mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/outerwilds) and put them in the Mods folder, each mod in a separate folder.
3. Start the game with OWML.Launcher.exe.

## For modders

Refer to the sample mods for examples.

### Get started

2. Install the [OWML Nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/OWML/).
3. Reference the following files in {gamePath}\OuterWilds_Data\Managed:

    * More Unity DLLs if needed
4. Inherit from ModBehaviour.

## Configuration

OWML is configured by OWML.Config.json:

|Key|Description|
|---|-----------|
|gamePath|The path to the game files.|
|verbose|If this is true, errors from all of the game will be displayed and logged. Intended for modders only.|

Each mod is defined in a manifest.json file:

|Key|Description|
|---|-----------|
|filename|The filename of the DLL containing the ModBehaviour class.|
|author|The name of the author.|
|name|The name of the mod.|
|uniqueName|Usually {author}.{uniqueName}.|
|version|The version number.|
|owmlVersion|The version of OWML the mod was built for.|
|enabled|Whether or not the mod will be loaded.|

Each mod can be configured with an optional config.json. A config file has a list of settings in the following format:

~~~~
{
  "settings": {
    "enableMusic": true,
    "foo": "bar",
    "lol": 1337
  }
}
~~~~
